# CATALOGUE Service

This service is a `NodeJS` service, So we need **NodeJS** to be installed .

1. Install NodeJS

```
# curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxautomations/labautomation/master/tools/nodejs/install.sh | bash 
```

2. As per standards of any realtime application we do not run any service as root user. Hence we need to create one user for this application and we need to start this service with a normal user which we created.

```
# useradd catalogue 
```

3. Install the dependencies of catalogue application.

```
